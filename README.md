### How's it Going üëã 

I'm Jake,

A Graphic Design Student with an A.F.A. currently obtaining a B.Des at Millersville University in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Studied Engineering at a vocational school and possess 3 computer certifications. Strong Design skills. Very good understanding of Electronics and Computers. Creative team player possesses excellent communication and interpersonal skills with effective time management.

I was diagnosed with a rare condition called Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) at the age of 3. Duchenne is a progressive muscle-wasting disease. "I fell in love with Graphic Design when I was a small child when I first picked up a paintbrush and computer. I saved up to buy my very own computer and art supplies".

As my disability has progressed design helped me truly express myself. I use my creativity so others see what goes through others' eyes. To see how they see things differently from different perspectives. I create content that is a reflection of real-life experiences. Graphic and Web Design is a recent pursuit of mine, and it opened my eyes and made me decide that is what I want to do and I want it to be my full-time job. I like to build for the web and make things pretty.

Collage and abstract art simply describe my designs because there are no limits to those methods, whether it is the hand-drawn line, silly characters, or font choices. My ambition is to make a difference and to create effective designs that leave its mark. All of my work is achieved by the use of the Adobe Creative Cloud software. I am also familiar with most design programs as well as traditional tools and media. My work consists of Logo Design, Web Design, Layout and typography, and UI/UX Design. 

I hope you enjoy my reflections on my journey as a Graphic Designer‚Ä¶
